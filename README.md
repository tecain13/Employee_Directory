### Employee Directory App
​

### Overview
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

### Problem
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. 

### Solution
This application allows an employee or manager to view non-sensitive data about other employees. Additionally, a user can narrow their search criteria by filtering employees by name.

### Tech and Features Used
​
React
Javascript
JQuery
Random User API
Axios

### How to use
​On the hosted webpage, the user has the ability to view 20 employees/users at a time (retrieved from the https://randomuser.me/ API). The user can sort alphabetically by first name, or by age, in both ascending order. The user can also use the search bar to filter the results (the filter applies to the first name column only).

### Technical Overview
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:

Sort the table by at least one category

Filter the users by at least one property.
